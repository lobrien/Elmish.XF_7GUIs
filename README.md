# Elmish.XF_7GUIs

This is my repo for learning elmish architecture, particularly for Xamarin.Forms (see [Elmish.XamarinForms](https://github.com/fsprojects/Elmish.XamarinForms).

I'll be working towards building the 7 increasingly-complex GUIs described at [7GUIs](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/tasks).
